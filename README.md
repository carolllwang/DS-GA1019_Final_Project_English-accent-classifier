## Overview

Automatic speech‐recognition systems often struggle with non-native English accents, leading to biased or inaccurate transcriptions. In this project, we build and compare three accent-classification pipelines, integrate advanced Python optimization techniques, and demonstrate that a VGGish-based model achieves the best balance of accuracy and efficiency.


## Note

Due to a limitation in GitHub’s online notebook renderer, you may see this error when viewing the `.ipynb` file on GitHub:

> **Error:** the `state` key is missing from `metadata.widgets`

This only affects the preview on GitHub — the notebook and its outputs are intact. To review the full content, please download the code files.
